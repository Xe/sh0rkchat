# SH0RKCHAT

HOLY HECK ITS CHAT TIME!

It's a heckin hacky as SHIT chat app made with [deno](https://deno.land),
[drash](https://drash.land/drash/v2.x/getting-started/introduction), and
[Xeact](https://github.com/Xe/Xeact). I definitely know what I am doing as a
professional adult.

This is hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io) here:

Enjoy! This is a minimal example of how to use Xeact and Deno together.
